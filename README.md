# KMeans Clustering

This repo contains my work in creating a KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch. 

A blog post about this process is contained [here](https://nealwhitlock.github.io/2020-06-26-K-Means-Clustering/)

The algorithm works and seems to provide the same results using Scikit-Learn's KMeans for clearly defined clusters. There is some disparity when the clusters are not so well defined but that is to be expected.
